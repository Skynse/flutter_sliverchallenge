        "description": "Create iOS and Android apps with Flutter using just one codebase. App development on multiple platforms has historically been difficult and complex. This book breaks down complex concepts and tasks into easily digestible segments with examples, pictures, and hands-on labs with starters and solutions. In doing so, you'll develop a basic understanding of the Dart programming language; the entire Flutter development toolchain; the differences between stateful and stateless widgets; and a working knowledge of the architecture of apps. All the most important parts of app development with Flutter are covered in this book. Work with themes and styles. Develop custom widgets. Teach your app to respond to gestures like taps, swipes, and pinches. Design, create and control the layout of your app. Create tools to handle form data entry from users. And ultimately create killer multiscreen apps with navigation, menus, and tabs. Flutter is Google's new framework for creating mobile apps that run on iOS and Android phones both.You had to be a super-developer to write apps for iOS or Android alone. But writing for both? Forget about it! You had to be familiar with Swift, Java/Kotlin, Xcode, Eclipse, and a bunch of other technologies simultaneously. Beginning App Development with Flutter simplifies the entire process. What You'll Learn Get the most out of great Flutter widgets Create custom widgets, both stateless and stateful Exercise expert control over your Flutter layouts Make your app respond to gestures like swiping, pinching and tapping Initiate async Ajax calls to RESTful APIs — including Google Firebase! Who This Book Is ForDevelopers who have coded in Java, C#, C++, or any similar language. It brings app development within the reach of younger developers, so STEM groups are likely to pick up the technology. Managers, product owners, and business analysts need to understand Flutter's capabilities.",

        "description": "The flutter characteristics of several wings with an aspect-ratio of 4.0, a taper ratio of 0.2, and a quarter-chord sweepback of 45 deg. have been investigated analytically for Mach numbers up to 2.0. The calculations were based on the modified-strip-analysis method, the subsonic-kernel-function method, piston theory, and quasi-steady second-order theory. Results of t h e analysis and comparisons with experiment indicated that: (1) Flutter speeds were accurately predicted by the modified strip analysis, although accuracy at t h e highest Mach numbers required the use of nonlinear aerodynamic theory (which accounts for effects of wing thickness) for the calculation of the aerodynamic parameters. (2) An abrupt increase of flutter-speed coefficient with increasing Mach number, observed experimentally in the transonic range, was also indicated by the modified strip analysis. (3) In the low supersonic range for some densities, a discontinuous variation of flutter frequency with Mach number was indicated by the modified strip analysis. An abrupt change of frequency appeared experimentally in the transonic range. (4) Differences in flutter-speed-coefficient levels obtained from tests at low supersonic Mach numbers in two wind tunnels were also predicted by the modified strip analysis and were shown to be caused primarily by differences in mass ratio. (5) Flutter speeds calculated by the subsonic-kernel-function method were in good agreement with experiment and with the results of the modified strip analysis. (6) Flutter speed obtained from piston theory and from quasi-steady second-order theory were higher than experimental values by at least 38 percent.",

Write your next app in one language and build it for both Android and iOS. Deliver the native look, feel, and performance you and your users expect from an app written with each platform's own tools and languages. Deliver apps fast, doing half the work you were doing before and exploiting powerful new features to speed up development. Write once, run anywhere. Learn Flutter, Google's multi-platform mobile development framework. Instantly view the changes you make to an app with stateful hot reload and define a declarative UI in the same language as the app logic, without having to use separate XML UI files. You can also reuse existing platform-specific Android and iOS code and interact with it in an efficient and simple way. Use built-in UI elements - or build your own - to create a simple calculator app. Run native Java/Kotlin or Objective-C/Swift methods from your Flutter apps, and use a Flutter package to make HTTP requests to a Web API or to perform read and write operations on local storage. Apply visual effects to widgets, create transitions and animations, create a chat app using Firebase, and deploy everything on both platforms. Get native look and feel and performance in your Android and iOS apps, and the ability to build for both platforms from a single code base. What You Need: Flutter can be used for Android development on any Linux, Windows or macOS computer, but macOS is needed for iOS development.",

With Flutter, developers can now build fast and native mobile apps from a single codebase. This book is packed with 11 projects that will help you build your own mobile applications using Flutter. It begins with an introduction to Dart programming and explains how it can be used with the Flutter SDK to customize mobile apps. Each chapter contains instructions on how to build an independent app from scratch, and each project focuses on important Flutter features.From building Flutter Widgets and applying animations to using databases (SQLite and sembast) and Firebase, you'll build on your knowledge through the chapters. As you progress, you’ll learn how to connect to remote services, integrate maps, and even use Flare to create apps and games in Flutter. Gradually, you’ll be able to create apps and games that are ready to be published on the Google Play Store and the App Store. In the concluding chapters, you’ll learn how to use the BLoC pattern and various best practices related to creating enterprise apps with Flutter. By the end of this book, you will have the skills you need to write and deliver fully functional mobile apps using Flutter. What you will learn Design reusable mobile architectures that can be applied to apps at any scale Get up to speed with error handling and debugging for mobile application development Apply the principle of ‘composition over inheritance’ to break down complex problems into many simple problems Update your code and see the results immediately using Flutter’s hot reload Identify and prevent bugs from reappearing with Flutter’s developer tools Manage an app's state with Streams and the BLoC pattern Build a simple web application using Flutter Web Who this book is for This book is for mobile developers and software developers who want to learn Flutter to build state-of-the-art mobile apps. Although prior experience with Dart programming or Flutter is not required, knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures and software design patterns will be beneficial.",

Ol5 to 0.045 inch, length-width ratio from 0.36 to 2.76, and radius-thickness ratio from 600 to infinity are presented. These results indicate a strong influence of differential pressure, which caused buckling on the flutter mode and on the dynamic pressure flutter for the curved panels. Results for both the flat and curved pan 5 fall within an extrapolation of an existing experimental panel flutter boundary.",

        "description": "Whirl flutter is the aeroelastic phenomenon caused by the coupling of aircraft propeller aerodynamic forces and the gyroscopic forces of the rotating masses (propeller, gas turbine engine rotor). It may occur on the turboprop, tilt-prop-rotor or rotorcraft aircraft structures. Whirl Flutter of Turboprop Aircraft Structures explores the whirl flutter phenomenon, including theoretical and practical as well as analytical and experimental aspects of the matter. The first introductory part gives a general overview regarding aeroelasticity, followed by the physical principle and the occurrence of whirl flutter in aerospace practice. The next section deals with experiment research including earlier activities performed, particularly from the sixties, as well as recent developments. Subsequent chapters discuss analytical methods such as basic and advanced linear models, and non-linear and CFD based methods. Remaining chapters summarize certification issues including regulation requirements, a description of possible certification approaches and several examples of aircraft certification from the aerospace practice. Finally, a database of relevant books and reports is provided. provides complex information of turboprop aircraft whirl flutter phenomenon presents both theoretical and practical (certification related) issues presents experimental research as well as analytical models (basic and advanced) of matter includes both early-performed works and recent developments contains a listing of relevant books and reports",
